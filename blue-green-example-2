In summary, the article discusses a blue-green deployment strategy for upgrading Kubernetes clusters on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Here are the key action plans simplified into steps:

**1. Evaluate Changes and Compatibility:**
   - Read the Istio and Kubernetes changelogs to understand changes in the latest versions.
   - Use tools like Kube-No-Trouble and istioctl to check compatibility with your existing cluster.

**2. Plan for Cluster Creation:**
   - Create a new cluster with the target version.
   - Update Terraform code to replicate the existing cluster with new resource names.
   - Ensure a proper naming convention for Terraform code.

**3. Deploy Istio and Applications:**
   - Bootstrap the new cluster.
   - Deploy Istio and validate its installation.
   - Update deployment process to deploy applications on both old and new clusters.

**4. Manage Traffic Switch:**
   - Use Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Target Groups.
   - Gradually shift traffic to the new cluster.
   - Monitor and validate application behavior during the traffic switch.

**5. Handle Stateful Sets:**
   - For applications with stateful sets, consider the backend storage (e.g., Amazon EBS).
   - Plan and execute a migration strategy for stateful applications.

**6. Finalize Upgrade:**
   - Stop indexing or making changes to the old cluster.
   - Disable shard allocation for Elasticsearch or similar data stores.
   - Scale down old cluster instances.
   - Deploy Helm releases in the new cluster.
   - Enable shard allocation to complete the upgrade.

**7. Validate Cluster Health:**
   - Check the status of the new cluster and applications.
   - Ensure the cluster is healthy and operational.

**8. Monitor and Troubleshoot:**
   - Monitor application logs and performance.
   - Use tools like kubectl and New Relic for investigation during the migration.

**9. Repeat for Each Cluster:**
   - Apply the blue-green deployment strategy to each cluster that needs upgrading.
   - Document the process to facilitate future upgrades.

For complex questions to ask your advanced AWS client, consider the following:

1. "Given our current AWS Transit Gateway setup, how can we optimize network traffic routing during the blue-green deployment process?"
2. "Can you provide insights into any custom resource definitions (CRDs) or Kubernetes add-ons that might introduce complexities during the upgrade?"
3. "What strategies have you employed for managing data consistency and integrity, especially for stateful applications, when transitioning to the new cluster?"
4. "In your experience, what challenges have you encountered with application dependencies and third-party integrations when adopting the blue-green deployment approach?"
5. "Could you elaborate on any strategies or tools you've used to ensure minimal application downtime and user impact during the transition between clusters?"

These questions should help you engage in a meaningful discussion with your client about the article's content and their specific AWS environment.
