Upgrade Process Overview:

Understand the context and the need for Kubernetes cluster upgrades.
Consider the challenges of compatibility and breaking changes.
Upgrade Paths:

Evaluate two upgrade solutions: standard upgrades and blue-green deployments.
Blue-Green Deployment Strategy:

Create a brand new cluster with the target Kubernetes and Istio versions.
Standard Upgrades (Non-breaking Changes):

Upgrade the control plane for Amazon EKS.
Trigger an instance refresh on nodes.
Perform rolling updates on nodes.
Handle statefulsets manually if required.
Blue-Green Deployment (Breaking Changes):

Create a new cluster with the latest versions.
Deploy applications on the new cluster.
Test applications thoroughly on the new cluster.
Gradually switch traffic to the new cluster.
Finalize the upgrade by shutting down the old cluster.
Naming Convention:

Use a naming convention (e.g., spoon and knife) to differentiate clusters.
Identify the cluster responsible for production traffic.
Workflow Overview:

Understand that blue-green deployments take more time than standard upgrades (1-2 months vs. 2-4 weeks).
Environment Isolation:

Ensure that all environments are isolated, except for specific clusters with connectivity.
AWS Resources Management:

Maintain control over AWS resources using Terraform, not Kubernetes.
Architecture Overview:

Use a consistent architecture across all environments in the Paris (eu-west-3) Region.
Employ an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic routing.
Utilize various AWS services such as RDS, Amazon EFS, Amazon S3, and Amazon ElastiCache.
Prerequisites:

Read Kubernetes and Istio changelogs.
Check compatibility of existing objects with new versions.
Use tools like Kube-No-Trouble and istioctl for compatibility checks.
Upgrade applications as needed, typically by updating Helm charts.
Validation and Testing:

Set up an isolated environment (integration) to validate the upgrade process.
Create the new cluster within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
Bootstrap the new cluster.
Deploy Istio and validate its installation.
Update deployment processes to target both old and new clusters.
Gradually switch traffic to the new cluster for testing.
Dealing with Statefulsets:

Develop specific migration plans for statefulsets with backend storage.
For example, for Elasticsearch:
Stop logstash instances.
Disable shard allocation.
Scale down instances in the old cluster.
Deploy Helm release in the new cluster.
Manage shard allocation activation.
Conclusion:

Emphasize the need for preparation, time, and patience for successful upgrades.
Recognize the higher initial cost of blue-green deployments but their long-term benefits.
Highlight the importance of documentation and planning for future upgrades.
These steps provide an overview of the blue-green deployment strategy for Kubernetes cluster upgrades as described in the article.


This article discusses how TheFork, an online restaurant booking and discovery platform, manages Kubernetes cluster upgrades using the blue-green deployment strategy. Here's a summary of the key points in the article:

Kubernetes is a rapidly evolving platform, and keeping clusters up-to-date is essential. However, upgrading can be challenging due to compatibility issues and breaking changes.

Upgrade Paths:

Solution One: Traditional approach involves upgrading Amazon EKS and Istio versions step by step, following compatibility matrices. This can result in a high number of upgrades (49 in this case), making it time-consuming and risky.
Solution Two: The blue-green deployment strategy is proposed, where a new cluster with the target version is created, and applications are gradually migrated to it. This strategy reduces the number of upgrades and associated risks.
Blue-Green Deployment:

For non-breaking changes, a standard upgrade is performed.
For breaking changes, a new cluster is created with the latest versions of Amazon EKS and Istio. Applications are deployed, tested, and traffic is switched gradually. The old cluster is eventually shut down.
Clusters are named using a convention (e.g., spoon and knife) to differentiate them.
This strategy offers flexibility but is more time-consuming than standard upgrades.
Validation and Prerequisites:

Changelogs of Kubernetes and Istio versions are reviewed.
Tools like Kube-No-Trouble and istioctl are used to check compatibility.
Applications are updated as needed, with Helm charts being a common choice.
Cluster Creation and Bootstrap:

New clusters are created within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
Terraform is used for infrastructure management.
Istio is installed, and application deployment processes are updated to target both old and new clusters.
Traffic Switch.

The upgrade process is as follows:
Creation of the new cluster inside the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Bootstrap of cluster
Deploy Istio and validate its installation
Update our deployment process to deploy on both clusters, and redeploy all our applications deployed in the first deployment
Do the traffic switch

Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Target Groups are used to gradually switch traffic to the new cluster.
Auto scaling is employed to handle increased traffic on the new cluster.
Dealing with Statefulsets:

Statefulsets with backend storage (e.g., Amazon EBS) require a different migration approach.
Specific migration plans are developed for each statefulset, such as Elasticsearch.
Shard allocation is managed to ensure a smooth transition.
